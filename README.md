# The_100_Days_In_Codeland_Solutions

Welcome to the IEEE ENSIAS student branch GitHub repository for "The 100 Days in Codeland" program! This repository contains the solutions for the weekly problem sets, where each week we cover a specific topic. The solutions are provided in both C++ and Python programming languages.

To access the solutions, please navigate to the appropriate week's folder. Within each folder, you will find the problem set for that week, as well as the solutions in both C++ and Python.

Please note that these solutions are intended for educational purposes only. We encourage you to use them as a reference to help you better understand the concepts covered in the program, but we also encourage you to attempt the problems on your own before consulting the solutions.

We hope that this repository will be a helpful resource for all participants of "The 100 Days in Codeland" program, and we welcome any contributions or feedback you may have. Thank you for your interest in our club and happy coding!
